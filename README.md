# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I always check to make sure my code is functional by writing unit tests to check every major function or requirement. Testing helped me fine errors early, especially edge cases or invalid formatting. Following simple, consistent validation rules (like checking input lengths or formats) helps with security as well as preventing bugs from getting into the final project.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by translating requirements into specific rules for the code to enforce. For example, if the requirement says "phone numbers must be exactly 10 digits," I know I need to validate that in the object constructor and test for it in my JUnit tests. I recognize it is important to focus on the details of the requirements because not following it as it is stated could lead to issues later on. Thinking about what a user might input wrong or misunderstand helped me build better code.

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by breaking things down into smaller, manageable pieces. I start by focusing on one class or feature at a time, making sure each part works perfectly on its own. Then I think about how each part needs to interact with others. In this course, I learned that setting strong boundaries between classes (like having ContactService manage Contact objects but not directly mess with their data) made everything easier to test, update, and understand later.
